# Assignment-14
Implement Oauth using passport JS in previous loopback application as a Loopback 4 component. Create a login page in UI. Add username field to user table. Implement login feature and ensure non logged in user is not able to access any other page in UI and any of the other APIs. Push the code to the repo on github. Generate a PR for review.

I have developed own jwt strategy in this. Please refer to repo - Assignment14-loopback-4-authentication where I have used local and bearer strategy provided by loopback4-authnetication.
